# Lab: Lightbulb Selections

In this lab you will practice selecting elements from HTML pages and using JavaScript to make those elements respond to a click event. Specifically, you will turn lights "on" and "off" by updating the CSS of elements you select!

## Part 1 - Basic House
Use document.querySelector() and classList.toggle() to make three lightbulbs interactive

## Part 2 - Advanced House
Use document.querySelectorAll() and a forEach loop to make many lightbulbs interactive
